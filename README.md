LOOP is a song composer created by Yotam Mann and [Elliot Blanchard](invisiblelightnetwork.com) in October 2013. 

The idea behind it was to enable a user to create a composition evolution and structure by manipulating some simple controls. 

There are three sections to the composition (Start, Middle, End) each with their own timbral and rhythmic parameters that you can tweak. When you're happy with all of your sounds, hit the play button in the bottom left corner to hear the music interpolate over time between the three sections that you set up.
