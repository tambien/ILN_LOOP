LOOP is a song composer created with Elliot Blanchard at [Invisible Light Network](invisiblelightnetwork.com). The idea behind it was to create a composition which the user could change and effect. 

There are three sections to the composition (Start, Middle, End) each with their own timbral and rhythmic parameters that you can tweak. When you're happy with all of your sounds, hit the play button in the bottom left corner to hear the music interpolate over time between the three sections that you set up.
